  abstract = {Community-based health care planning and regulation necessitates grouping
	facilities and areal units into regions of similar health care use.
	Limited research has explored the methodologies used in creating
	these regions. We offer a new methodology that clusters facilities
	based on similarities in patient utilization patterns and geographic
	location. Our case study focused on Hospital Groups in Michigan,
	the allocation units used for predicting future inpatient hospital
	bed demand in the state's Bed Need Methodology. The scientific, practical,
	and political concerns that were considered throughout the formulation
	and development of the methodology are detailed.},
